# The PyDar Script
The PyDar Script is essentially a more complex "Hello, World" Python Script, made by Jaydar. That's all you need to know.

# Notes
- This is my first Python script ever, so it's really stupid.
- As of right now, the Conda GitHub Environment for Python isn't working. Because I'm stupid.
